#挑战简介
===== Welcome to Access Control! =====
In this series of challenges, you will be working with various access control systems.
Break the system to get the flag.


In this challenge you will work understand how the SETUID bit for UNIX permissions works.

What if /bin/cp had the SETUID bit set?

Hint: Look into how cp will deal with different permissions.

Another Hint: check the man page for cp, any options in there that might help?


Before:
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 153976 Sep  5  2019 /bin/cp
After:
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 153976 Sep  5  2019 /bin/cp

#这边和上一次唯一的区别，给了cp程序权限
#你要会用cp(copy)
#cp FILE TO_FILE
