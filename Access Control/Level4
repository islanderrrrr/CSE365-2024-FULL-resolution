In this challenge you will work understand how the SETUID bit for UNIX permissions works.

What if /bin/cat had the SETUID bit set?


Before:
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 43416 Sep  5  2019 /bin/cat
After:
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 43416 Sep  5  2019 /bin/cat

#SUID 即SETUID，设定某个程序，让user可以在用它的时候获取与root同等的权限
#同样也有SGID

直接cat便是
